## Top 10 Custard E-Juice Flavors

### 10 - Orphan Tears by Fuzion Vapor (Formerly by Grand Vapors)

This flavor was at first made by Grand Vapors - and technically they got credit for it inside our poll - but now Orphan Tears is made by Fuzion Vapor, after they bought the recipe from Grand Vapors.

The liquid is a mixture of kiwi and custard, generating a distinctive flavor with the sweetness and slight tartness of the fruit blended with a basic of custard with some subtle notes of cinnamon added in. The juice's flavor profile improvements predicated on your wattage, with the kiwi getting considerably more prominent at higher settings and the custard taking center-stage when you dial it down just a little. The result is usually a custard e-liquid vapers absolutely like, you can tailor to your requirements using a VV/VW mod.

### 9 - Whirling Dervish by Vape Orenda

Vape Orenda's Whirling Dervish received a whole lot of votes in our poll of the best e-liquid, and ranks among the top custard vape juice flavors according to the benefits, with the vanilla custard mix mixing in factors of honey, fruits, exotic spices and other elements to make a complex and delicious vape.

The complexity of the flavor signifies that it varies notably together with your temperature or wattage setting, and several vapers grab different subtle notes from the juice, including (but definitely not limited by) clove, cinnamon, ginger, faint notes of tobacco and chai tea. Despite the disagreement about the parts of the flavor, many vapers rank this blend one of the better custard flavors on the market.

Whirling Dervish comes in five nicotine amounts - from 0 to 18 mg/ml - and a 30 ml bottle.

### 8 - Starship 1 by Space Jam E-Juice

Space Jam is probably the most popular e-juice makes in the market in its right, but Starship 1 also ranks among the very best custard juice flavors on the market according to your poll.

The flavor mixes vanilla custard with kiwi, creating a juice much like Orphan Tears, with the vanilla custard dominating the inhale and the kiwi being fairly subtle throughout but more prominent on the exhale, and the whole thing being overlaid with an over-all sweetness. Vapers generally take pleasure in this juice, possibly those who don't generally like custard-based e-liquids.

### 7 - Grant's Vanilla Custard

This is just about the most legendary vanilla custard e-liquids in the market, and even though it's incredibly hard to pick up a bottle of, many vapers firmly rank it among the most notable custard vape juice flavors on the market. The flavor is well known as a nice, creamy and sensible vanilla custard vape with hints of spice spending the juice to another level, and for many it's the yardstick against which other vanilla custard juices happen to be measured.

The big problem is that the juice simply continues on sale periodically, and when it is through to sale - you get two weeks prior notice on the site - the buying frenzy brings about the juice for sale out much too quickly for most vapers to achieve the chance to order. Although this is a huge limitation for the juice, it didn't prevent it rank among the most notable 10 custard vape juices inside our poll.

The flavor comes in a choice of three PG/VG ratios (50/50 as standard) and comes in the ordinary range of nicotine levels.

### 6 - Big Willie's Custard

That is another legendary vanilla custard e-juice, and thankfully one that's a whole lot easier to get yourself a bottle of than Grant's version. The juice basically tied with Grant's Vanilla Custard inside our best e-juice poll, but the greater option of this juice earns it the higher spot in the ultimate ranking.

Big Willie's Custard is built around a typical vanilla custard e-liquid, with the custard being rich and creamy, along with added components of vanilla and a correctly balanced sweetness. The thing that units this juice apart from the pack may be the inclusion of butterscotch elements to the taste, giving the whole lot another dimension and keeping vapers coming back for more.

The e-liquid comes in six nicotine amounts (from 0 up to 24 mg/ml), a PG/VG ratio of 50/50 or 78 % VG, and can be bought in 15 or 30 ml bottles.

### 5 - Berry Untraditional by Vapor Jerry's

Berry Untraditional took more than 1.1 percent of the vote in our best e-juice flavors poll - which might not sound like a whole lot, but with thousands of e-juice flavors available to buy, it's an enormous percentage of the vote - and it just breaks the top 5 custard e-juice flavors.

The flavor is obviously untraditional, mixing strawberries and mango in with custard for a distinctive take on a classic e-liquid flavor, with most vapers hugely enjoying the juice. The mango elements of the flavour are a little too strong for most vapers, with some seeking the strawberry dialed up higher in the mix, therefore it's worth considering your options if you aren't a major fan of mango. It goes without saying that the juice possesses even more fans than detractors, though.

Berry Untraditional comes in 0, 3, 6 and 12 mg/ml of nicotine, with a good PG/VG ratio of 30/70 and a good 30 ml bottle.

### 4 - Sir Mac by Brother's Reserve

Sir Mac is another vanilla custard flavour causing this to be list of the very best custard vape juice flavours, and it had been ranked in the top 20 out of all e-juice flavors available in our poll. The juice is definitely well-loved, and markets itself without a hint of modesty as 'suite possibly the greatest e-juice in the history of vaping'.

The flavor is a spin on the original vanilla custard flavor, taking the core flavors and adding various additional flavor notes to the mix to produce something more complex and rewarding. Cinnamon is the most commonly noted extra element to the flavour, adding an extra bakery-design hint to the taste, however, many vapers also grab nutmeg from the juice.

Sir Mac comes as a 70 percent70 % VG combine and will be bought found in the standard five nicotine amounts, from nicotine-free ideal up to 18 mg/ml.

### 3 - Caution Shot by Cold Fusion

Warning Shot is the most popular flavour from Cold Fusion, and it took around 1.7 % of the vote inside our best e-juice flavors poll, earning it an area among the most popular custard e-liquid flavors in the marketplace.

The flavor is a berries and custard blend, with strawberry being widely-identified as a component, but with other berry factors adding some depth to the flavor and the whole lot being topped off with a creamy, custard-infused exhale. The combination of strawberries and creamy undertones invites comparisons with Mother's Milk and Unicorn Milk, however the robust dynamics of the strawberry flavour and the fine-tuned degree of sweetness sets this juice ahead of the pack in the thoughts of many.

Warning shot is a 70 %70 % VG blend, obtainable in the typical five nicotine amounts and with a 30 ml bottle.

### 2 - M.B.Y.C. by Sicboy

This juice made the top 10 out of all the juices out there, and Sicboy's unique mixture of praline, ice cream and vanilla custard earns second place in this list. The custard elements may be even more of a helping flavour to the nutty praline and the lovely ice cream components, working more to spherical out the other flavours a lot more than as a primary preference, however the vanilla custard is present throughout in this juice and really helps to produce it an all-day-vape for most.

The resulting flavor is rich, creamy and smooth, bearing the right amount of sweetness to keep you returning without crossing the brand and becoming sickly. Every part is beautifully balanced, and the result can be an e-liquid vapers can't get more than enough of.

M.B.Y.C. is available in 0, 3, 6 or 12 mg/ml of nicotine and a PG/VG ratio of 35/65, offering a nice throat reach but a primarily smooth, VG-heavy vape.

### 1 - Soul Custardy by Beantown Vapor

Taking third place inside our total poll of the greatest e-juice tastes, Soul Custardy simply by Beantown Vapor is the most well-liked custard vape juice available to buy based on our poll. The flavour is normally another vanilla custard blend, with Beantown adding notes of bourbon, graham cracker and butterscotch to give the juice some personality and split it from the large number of vanilla custard e-juices available to buy.

This is one of the most recommended juices to fans of custard e-liquid, with the bourbon and smooth vanilla custard dominating the inhale but with the graham cracker and butterscotch giving the exhale some extra complexity and depth. The bourbon is smooth, and because of the subtle aspect of this and the other factors of the juice, the vanilla and custard components have the ability to shine through without getting lost in the blend. The tastes are expertly balanced, and it keeps vapers coming back for more.

Soul Custardy is available in 0, 3, 6 and 12 mg/ml of nicotine, and costs $17.99 for a 30 ml bottle. However, the second version is because of be replaced rapidly (with a fresh blend), hence if you would like to try the one vapers will be raving about, it's worth inserting an purchase before it's too past due. Although it's hard to imagine the V3 becoming anything apart from delicious.

The mixture of the fruity flavor with the rich, creamy vanilla custard causes this among the top custard flavors on the market for all of us, and the taste is topped off with caramelized sugar and caramel once and for all measure.

### 9 - Prototype C by Project Sub Ohm

This Task Sub Ohm mix is another fruit and custard mix to make our top 10 10 custard e-liquid flavors list, combining bananas and caramel with vanilla custard. The blend works perfectly, with the creamy, well-captured vanilla custard serving as a backdrop to the caramel-sweetened bananas, with an accurate fruity flavour that comes through nice and highly. The bananas really supply the juice its figure, but the custard supplies the depth and richness that continues you coming back.

### 8 - F.U.E.S. by the typical Vape

The Typical Vape's F.U.E.S. is usually a vanilla custard e-juice with cream to improve the richness of the mixture. It might not add any main additional components to separate it from the pack, but it pulls off the basic flavor exceptionally well. It's also something of a 'mystery' mix, and there are touches of extra taste notes in there that help differentiate it from the large number of other custard e-juices available to buy, with nearly peppery notes arriving through from time to time.

### 7 - Banana Cream Pie by Mt. Baker Vapor

Although Mt. Baker possesses Vanilla Custard, where the custard plays a more substantial role, the delicate notes of custard in Banana Cream Pie - combined with the reality the juice is normally delicious - sets it among our picks for the most notable custard vape tastes. The flavor is just about what the name suggests, with authentic-tasting bananas becoming supported by simple custard, topped off with hints of nuts and graham cracker.

### 6 - Sacre Coeur by NJOY (Artist Collection)

This juice originates from NJOY's Artist Collection, and was mixed by Anne-Claire of Vaponaute. The juice is normally a complex combination of berry, almond torte and rhubarb, supported by European custard and delicate touches of bourbon, producing a multi-tonal, layered taste that's largely pulled together by the even custard. The effect is a somewhat tangy, tart, pastry-design juice with the custard and bourbon rounding everything out beautifully.

### 5 - Duke by King's Crest

Duke by King's Crest is a good vanilla custard juice, and may make our list for both pulling off this old classic flavor expertly, also for the addition of different, minor flavour notes that are actually hard to place your finger on. The taste is obviously unique, with the tricky to pin down small flavor notes adding personality to the juice, but the creamy, abundant and smooth custard ensuring that every puff can be an absolute delight.

### 4 - Bourbon Custard by Cotto's Revenge

This juice blends a custard base with vanilla, toasted almond and bourbon, hitting on an absolute flavor blend that's pretty similar to Castle Long by Five Pawns. The juice is normally thoroughly delicious, with the bourbon becoming fairly subtle, and adding its one of a kind flavour notes to the even, creamy vanilla custard and producing the whole lot, alongside the delicate notes of practically, and producing the juice a definite all-moment vape.

### 3 - VCT by Ripe Vapes

VCT stands for vanilla custard tobacco, and that's specifically everything you get with this juice: a fascinating mixture of complex tobacco and a good creamy vanilla bean custard. It could not seem just like the flavors will continue to work well together, however the result is really wonderful, with the tobacco staying softened perfectly by the vanilla custard, while even now carrying through enough of the robust flavour to separate the juice from the large number of vanilla custards available.

### 2 - Rainbow Custard by VaporFi (Grand Reserve)

VaporFi's Grand Reserve Collection sees the mixer turning its hand to high grade juices, and the email address details are generally wonderful. Rainbow Custard belongs to this collection, and combines tangerine and strawberries with an English custard for a distinctive, fruity and multi-tonal juice that we're put proper up there with the most notable custard flavors on the market. The fruits do have center-level in the juice, however the custard will there be throughout, keeping the whole experience smooth and delicious.

### 1 - Eclipse by Space Jam

This juice is very much like VCT from Ripe Vapes, combining a Cavendish tobacco with vanilla custard for a unique spin on the fairly run-of-the-mill e-juice flavor. We think this is the very best custard vape juice on the market thanks to the masterful equilibrium of flavors, but also the base of Cavendish tobacco, which carries hints of sweetness in its right and will help the tobacco relax in to the mix. It falls smoothly, but still includes a robust and delightful flavor.
