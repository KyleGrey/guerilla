While sub ohm tanks undoubtedly dominate the market for vaping tanks, many vapers are still on the lookout for the very best atomizer tank and clearomizer. These devices might not provide huge vapor development you get with sub ohm tanks, but with generally extra limited airflow and narrower-bore coils, they are excellent for mouth-to-lung vaping and vapers more interested in extreme flavor than enormous clouds. But what are the very best atomizer tanks in this category? Which tanks display you could still enjoy excellent performance with resistances above 1 ohm?

What’s the Difference Between a Sub Ohm Tank and a Clearomizer?

The truth is: the distinction between sub ohm tanks and standard clearomizers isn’t as strictly thought as our decision to have two lists could have you believe. If you could stick a coil with a sub ohm level of resistance in a traditional-design clearomizer, there will be very little you could utilize to differentiate it from a sub ohm tank.

So this list will primarily focus on the best clearomizers in the traditional-style, but the main factor is the sort of vape you get from the tank. Generally, standard, beginner-friendly clearomizers possess a more limited airflow better fitted to mouth to lung vaping, whereas sub ohm tanks have wider open up airflow for direct-to-lung inhales and enormous clouds. This means you can have a tank which technically classes as a sub ohm tank but performs similar to a more traditional clearomizer, whether on the whole or with a particular coil. We’ll be incorporating a couple of tanks such as this in this list - they’re well-appropriate to beginners searching for a smoking-like knowledge, so the fact that they’re technically sub ohm devices isn’t overly important.

The upshot is that there are a few differences between the two, however the biggest is performance, so we won’t be sticking with any strict definitions in this post. Have a look at our new Ideal Sub-Ohm Tanks list for vape tank options.

Greatest Atomizer Vape Tanks and Clearomizers

10 - Evod 2 by Kanger
The Evod 2 is just about the most traditional clearomizer-style gadget on this list of the very best atomizer tanks. With a 14.5 mm (0.57 inch) diameter, a 1.5 ml tank and an visual aspect perfectly suited to eGo-style devices, it might not appear to be anything special on paper, however the performance, ease-of-use and very good deal make it an excellent option for newer vapers. The tank includes 1.5 ohm dual coils, and fills from underneath, designed in order to gain access to the coil without needing to empty your tank. This isn’t for the cloud-chasers, but if you’ve just picked up an eGo-style system and you will want capable but simple atomizer, this is probably the most trusted, solidly-performing basic clearomizers in the marketplace.

9 - EMOW by Kanger
Kanger’s EMOW is quite similar to the Protank, which was a legendary machine in the earlier times of vaping, but also for mouth-to-lung loving vapers - despite its old-style style - the EMOW ranks one of the better atomizer tanks available to buy. Boasting a cup tank with a 1.8 ml capacity, an adaptable airflow system (which is merely just like the one you’ll get on the Kanger Aerotank) and a bottom dual coil design (with 1.5 ohm heads as typical), it still has a lot going for it despite as an older-style clearomizer, and the small-bore coils and chimney mean it’s an excellent device for flavor.

8 - Aspire K3 Tank
Although you may have to pick this up in a kit, we’d put the Aspire K3 Tank as among the finest e-cig tanks in this class. The cup tank has a 2 ml potential, and the narrow-bore of the chimney - in mixture with the closed-off airflow adjustments - makes it a fantastic alternative for anyone looking for a great mouth-to-lung vape. It includes two 1.8 ohm coils, and with the accompanying battery pack it includes vaping at 9 to 13 W, which is plenty of for a higher-ohm coil. Both work together very well, and are a fantastic option for newer vapers looking for a simple mouth-to-lung vaping knowledge.

7 - Triton 2 by Aspire
This product will be featured on our list of the very best sub ohm tanks too, but it ranks on this list for having a 1.8 ohm coil that’s flawlessly suitable for mouth-to-lung vaping. The tank features 3 ml capacity glass tank, with a top-filling system, changeable airflow and a 22.5 mm diameter. Of course, as a sub ohm tank, this also includes the choice of sub ohm coils and a distinct type of performance from your clearomizer-style set up. But with the airflow closed off and the mouth-to-lung friendly coil installed, this device has a draw like traditional clearomizers with a good large tank plus some more modern design features to create your vaping experience as user-friendly as possible.

6 - eGo One Tank by Joyetech
The eGo One may be the up-to-day incarnation of the classic Joyetech eGo, with sub ohm capability and plenty to provide vapers of most experience amounts. The tank ranks as among the best atomizer tanks in this school thanks to its 1 ohm atomizer head suitable for mouth-to-lung vaping, and in mixture with the adjustable airflow, it creates it an excellent option for vapers buying a cigarette-like draw in their vaping device. Much like the Triton (and some others upon this list) it also includes sub ohm coils (a 0.5 ohm option is included in the kit), which means you also have additional options if your requirements change as you get accustomed to vaping. The device includes a 2.5 ml tank, which isn’t as big as various other options but is more than enough for non-sub-ohm vaping.

5 - Nautilus X Compact MTL by Aspire
The Aspire Nautilus has a special place in the heart of several vapers, and the Nautilus X continues in the proud tradition and makes its intent clear: that is a tank for mouth-to-lung (MTL) loving vapers. The result is a machine that offers many of the trappings of newer designs - like the top-filling system - with higher-ohm dual vertical coils (with two 1.5 ohm atomizer heads included) and an variable airflow system you can modify to your liking. The airflow comes in from the most notable of the device, with an ground breaking design designed to remove problems with leaking, and the tank features fantastic flavor. It’s also small (as the name suggests), with a 22 mm diameter but simply measuring 45 mm high, but still offering a 2 ml tank capacity.

4 - Cubis Tank by Joyetech
The Cubis Tank from Joyetech produces this list of the very best clearomizer tanks because together with being truly a capable sub ohm tank, in addition, it has two higher-ohm coils that give a more traditional, mouth-to-lung vaping experience. The tank includes a 3.5 ml capacity, with a top-filling, user-friendly design that makes it exquisite for newer vapers, and it’s also made to minimize leaking. For the higher-ohm coils, you get yourself a 1 ohm stainless option (used for temp control vaping) and a 1.5 ohm Clapton coil (which boosts flavor), and the airflow control could be turned right down to suit mouth-to-lung vaping.

3 - Endura Prism T18 by Innokin
This is one of the hottest and best atomizer tanks designed particularly for mouth to lung vaping, with 1.5 ohm atomizer heads, a top-filling design and an changeable airflow design. It can carry 2.5 ml of juice, which is ideal for a mouth-to-lung product designed to work at lower wattages. This all combines to make it a good clearomizer for newer vapers, blending simpleness with a cigarette-like draw, and the no-spill coil swap program (which is also used on the iSub series of sub ohm tanks) produces changing your coils as simple as possible. It’s designed to use the Endura T18, however the tank’s modern style and mouth-to-lung friendly pull has managed to get a most desired in its right too.

2 - VaporFi Rebel Tank
VaporFi includes a wide and developing selection of top-quality vaping products, and while the prices will get a little on top of occasion, the performance, style and reliability is constantly a step above your competition. The Rebel Tank is an old offering from the manufacturer, but using its Nautilus-like design, 2.6 ohm dual coils and large 4 ml tank capacity, it still has a lot to provide for vapers buying a traditional-design clearomizer. The tank has an adjustable airflow program, although most of the airflow adjustments are pretty restricted, and in addition an adjustable juice move system in order to tailor the tank’s performance to your juice’s PG/VG ratio.

1 - Aspire Nautilus Mini
The Aspire Nautilus Mini is widely considered to be one of the best e-cig tanks for mouth-to-lung vapers, but it’s vital that you note that the standard-size version of the Nautilus also has a whole lot of support from vapers. We’ve combined them below so we are able to feature other tanks too.

The Nautilus and Nautilus Mini are both stainless tanks with Pyrex glass tubes, with the Mini offering a 2 ml juice capacity and the Nautilus offering 5 ml. The devices offer flexible airflow - with four holes which range from 0.9 to at least one 1.8 mm that you decide on by turning a band - and use bottom vertical coils with resistances of 1 1.6, 1.8 and 2.1 ohms. They have normal 510 threading, and boast a leak-free design. Despite the fact that they aren’t sub-ohm tanks, for vapers not also interested in creating huge clouds, they’re a lot more than capable of meeting your vaping necessities.

Conclusion
Even in market saturated with sub ohm tanks, more traditional design clearomizers still have lots of staunch supporters, with many vapers who prefer oral cavity to lung vaping keeping them even if this means using older styles. While sub ohm tanks may be simply perfect for cloud-chasers, mouth-to-lung vaping even more closely replicates the feeling of smoking and genuinely gets to the center of what vaping is centered on: making the switch to a many safer supply of your nicotine. Consequently while the unit might certainly not have all the extravagant extras and innovative designs you’ll get on newer tanks, they give something very few contemporary sub ohm tanks carry out: a great setup for innovative vapers or those who even now want a cigarette-like pull. Some longer-term vapers may scoff at your Nautilus, but if it’s what gets results for you, be confident that you’ve determined the best clearomizer for you. And that’s all that counts.
