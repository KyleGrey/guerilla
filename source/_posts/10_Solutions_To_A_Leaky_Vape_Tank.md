Leaky vape tanks have to be the most annoying things vapers have to cope with. A leak can happen anywhere and at any time, departing you with a real mess that you have to clean up.

Imagine this - you’re jogging down the street and, finally, there’s nobody behind you in order to use your mod and have a nice, long puff with out enveloping someone’s brain in your vapor - by least, I’m considerate like this. You reach into your pocket and…it’s a slippery mess within! Your mod is totally protected in vape juice but that’s not all - your phone is slimy, too. To make things worse, there’s a fairly nasty wet spot growing near your crotch region. You know what’s heading on and a fellow vaper might understand it also, but there’s no sum of explanation that’s likely to save you from getting mortified looks from innocent bystanders.

I’ve had this eventually me, twice. I’ve heard a whole lot worse horror tales regarding leaky vape tanks from persons going on job interviews or assembly their in-laws for the first time. There’s without doubt - leaky vapes are the bane of vaper’s presence. The post on this link deals in detail with cartridge leaks. Nevertheless, tanks are a completely different beast thus I’ve decided to get this to particular write-up about them.

Remember, finding a remedy to leaky vapes isn't just about saving your vape gear and different valuable possessions, it’s likewise about saving face. Thus let’s explore the common factors behind leaky vapes and see if there will be any easy fixes which can be used that don’t require investing in a new tank or visiting a vape shop.

Why Is My Vape Leaking?
Unfortunately, there’s no universal answer to this concern. Vape tanks can leak for a wide variety of reasons that can range from manufacturing defect and style faults to mishandling and basic bad luck.

Even so, let’s assume that you’ve had the nice fortune of shopping for a decently crafted (and machined) tank. Why is it then even now leaking? Here are several (more prevalent) issues that could possibly be causing it:

 - Mishandling your vape tank
 - Not maintaining your eye on the parts
 - Improper vaping technique
 - Using the incorrect vape juice
 
There are several problems that could cause leakage in each one of these categories. Fortunately, most are pretty simple to fix by utilizing a few simple methods handed down in one vaping technology to the other.

1. Fill Your Container Up The Right Way
The most typical cause for a leaky tank is linked with beginner vapers not knowing how to do it the correct way. It’s pretty evident - if you get things wrong straight from the get-choose, you can only expect complications down the line.

Most tanks possess a central tube top rated from the coil to the mouthpiece. That tube is called the chimney and if you accidentally (or deliberately) get vape juice within, your container will most definitely leak. This specific problem is called flooding. After the coil is certainly flooded, it will begin to gurgle and steep vape juice deeper in to the assembly, until it finally starts oozing out somewhere.

To avoid this, make sure you pour the vape juice in to the tank by allowing it to slide down within the outer glass. Suggestion the tank somewhat for much easier filling and slowly straighten it since it fills. End when three-quarters full and make sure you remove extra juice from the central tube if a few of finds its method there (work with a cotton swab or a bit of tissue).

2. Keep carefully the Tank Vertical constantly
Whenever you’re not making use of your vape, you should make certain that it’s left within an upright position. Some tanks are not designed to spend long periods of time in a laid down. It has related to juice holes on the coil. If a tank is half-empty, the juice will quickly seep through those holes and find it’s approach to the chimney or the airflow holes.

3. Tighten Everything After Refills
Although vape tanks were made to be exposed and shut again on a pretty frequent basis, that’s not to say that there won’t be issues stemming from a awful fit or cross-threading. Usually, when refilling (and exchanging the coil), you will need to unscrew two things: a) the tank from the bottom, and b) the coil from the base/top cap.

There are plenty of opportunities for something to fail here. To be sure that nothing leak-worthy happens, take extra time when reassembling your container. Ensure that the coil is normally tightly secured to the bottom (or the top-cap, should you have a top coil container) and that all the parts in shape snugly. In order to avoid cross-threading, merely follow these easy steps:

 - Line everything up while preparing to screw it again together
 - Convert anticlockwise until you feel (or hear) it press in place
 - Little by little screw it in by turning clockwise

4. Avoid Over-Tightening
As bad as not really tightening everything during reassembly is, over-tightening can in fact cause even more issues and bring about leaking. That’s because every container is installed with o-rings - gaskets that can prevent leaking.

These o-rings are constructed of rubber and so are pretty delicate. Being that they are located near threading (and anywhere two parts of the tank meet), they may easily get snagged. If indeed they do, over-tightening may damage them. All it requires is just a little break in the o-ring for vape juice to think it is and begin seeping out.

Tightening everything back is normally, as you can plainly see, a delicate task - what’s too restricted and what’s not restricted enough? This depends a whole lot on the container involved, but, generally, you intend to screw everything firmly, however, not thus firmly that you have to use brute push to unscrew it once again. The bottom line is - tighten until you are feeling a bit of resistance in that case give it your final (gentle) turn.

5. Examine and Replace O-Rings If Needed
It’s not merely over-tightening that may damage the o-bands - they can be damaged by vape juice or perhaps wear out over time. That’s why it’s vital that you regularly check their state (best when you’re washing your vape container). If the o-bands are damaged, it will be easy to location once you remove them from the container. To remove them, you will require a small screwdriver or tweezers - whatever can help you pry them off the basic/cup/threading, or wherever else they could be.

Also, o-rings don’t have to be damaged to cause a leak, they are able to simply be bent out of shape. On a regular basis check them for signals of destruction or non-alignment. If they have to be substituted, you will find that a lot of manufacturers include spares which should have arrived together with your purchase. If they didn’t, you will need to order the proper size or go to a vape shop. Fitting them back again to the tank isn't a problem and a new group of o-rings should clear up any issues you’ve had with leaking.

6. Make use of Coils That Fit Your Style of Vaping
There are two types of vapers out there - mouth to lung vapers and direct to lung vapers. It's understandable that various kinds of coils are required for each of these styles. M2L vaping requires high-resistance coils (over 1 ohm), that may generally have smaller sized juice holes. Match that with a higher PG vape juice, and you have got M2L heaven. Alternatively, D2L vaping uses coils which may have greater juice holes which were created for high VG juices.

That’s where in fact the problems begin. If you want to employ a predominantly PG vape juice (therefore a thinner vape juice) with coils made for D2L vaping, leaks will quickly carry out. That’s because these coils will guzzle an excessive amount of juice without being able to quickly vaporize it and the surplus will wrap up flooding the chimney and seeping out of the tank.

Remember - use superior PG vape juice only with M2L coils, that's, with coils which may have smaller sized juice holes. Like that, you won’t have problems with leaking which can be traced back again to the coil flooding because it’s not equipped to deal with that very much vape juice in one go.

7. Close Airflow When Refilling
Ok, this one is a little of a great urban myth as We can’t find whatever proves that closing the airflow even though refilling can prevent leaks. Even so, a bunch of folks swear because of it (and it worked well for me in some instances, too), so I guess it doesn’t harm to try it.

The overall idea around closing the bottom airflow when refilling has to do with pressure and vacuum. If wide open, it will cause vape juice to be pulled into the airflow ring through the seams. Closing the airflow prevents that from happening. Some vapers even advise turning the tank ugly when it’s total and briefly starting the airflow in that position before straightening it once again.

Will this work? Probably. Does it expense you anything to check it out? Not necessarily. If you’re having issues with an especially troublesome and leaky container, I would offer this one a try, regardless of the simple fact that it could be only wishful thinking.

8. Take Slow and Soft Inhales
Based on your inhalation design, you might be triggering your container to leak by yourself. Most newbie vapers are not sure how exactly to puff on an e-cigarette hence they do it as they would on a normal one. Needless to say, vapes are pretty sensitive to how forcefully and quickly you inhale and you can’t handle them like analogs.

Quick and sharpened inhales might be the norm with smoking, but is a problem when you’re vaping. That’s because you may end up pulling additional juice in the coil than can be vaporized at confirmed time. Of program, once that occurs, the chimney will get flooded and the juice begins seeping out wherever it could.

Instead, try sluggish inhales because vapor will variety regardless of how fast you puff. A bit longer draws are more flavorsome regardless, and you don’t risk flooding your coil that approach.

9. Increase the Wattage
It’s pretty obvious by now that a lot of leaking problems are due to flooding the coil. One of the more common fixes for that is simply upping your wattage so your vape has more power to manage stray vape juice. When you improve the wattage on your device, the coil gets hotter faster and vaporizers extra e-juice with every puff.

This is not an excellent solution, however. Sometimes, extra power means different flavour and can even lead to dry hits. Even now, it’s something that’s worth looking into if most of your vape leaks happen to be caused by flooding.

10. Clean Your Vape Tank Regularly
A dirty vape tank will certainly be prone to all sorts of complications, including appearing more likely to leak. The buildup of gunk from past vape sessions can really affect all the parts inside - o-rings, airflow assembly, threading, etc.

That’s why it’s vital that you clean a vape container on a regular basis. Every week or so, simply take it apart and present it a good rinse in warm water. Check all of the parts and be sure to take out vape juice that accumulates on everything, together with small specks of dirt that will undoubtedly find their way in.

The ‘ Leaky Vape Tank ’ Problem Made Bearable

Implementing the solutions right here will definitely make the leaky tank problem even more bearable. However, it’s important to note that some tanks won't be leak-proof. All we are able to do is ensure that the issue is manageable.

Privately, my suggestion to all or any beginner vapers is to obtain a top-fill tank with a high airflow when starting out. I found that these have a tendency to leak minimal (declaring that they don’t leak at all would be a smooth out lie, unfortunately). From then on, if you have any leakage problems, you will have to take up with it until you locate a solution that functions for you personally. Hopefully, that option will be upon this list.

We can’t completely stop vape leaks but we are able to definitely fight them! Do you have a favorite alternative for a leaky vape that I didn’t point out? Drop a comment below - I’m sure there’s a frustrated vaper out there who'll appreciate it!
